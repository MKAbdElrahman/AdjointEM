# AdjointEM
There  several goals for this project:
1. Give an introduction to basics of the most common computational methods 
in electrodynamics including the finite difference method, the finite element method and the method of moments.
2. Implement simple one dimensioaal example for each computational technique.
3. Understand constraind opimization  or inverse design of photonic devices.  
4. Explore the different approaches for inverse design and understand thier strengths and weaknesses. 
5. Unferstand the typical workflow when carring inverse design, including
    - Choosing a set of design objectives.
    - Defining a set of  constraints (fabrication, material,footprint, bandwidth, radiation losses,directivity,   ..).
    - Understand the factors that help in discovering final robsut  devices.
    - Choosing a suitable  filtering and projection technique for feature size control.

5- Once, we get the basics in 1D, we will move to 2D and 3D and add more material models (anistropic, dispersive, nonlinear, .. ) 

At the end ,we shoud be able to model and inverse design deviceslike waveguides bends, tapers, polarization rotators, wavelength multiplixers, spatial mode multiplixers,  nonlinear switches, ...). We should be able to inverse design any photonic device :).
